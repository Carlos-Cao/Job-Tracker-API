# Job‚ÄëTracker‚ÄëAPI

A RESTful API for tracking job applications: creating, updating, querying, and managing jobs in an organized way.
Built in Java (or the language/tech stack you used), this API aims to serve as a backend for job hunting dashboards, portfolio projects, or productivity tools.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

**Job‚ÄëTracker‚ÄëAPI** is designed to allow users (or client applications) to:

* Add / create new job application entries
* Update statuses (e.g. applied, interviewing, rejected, offer)
* Retrieve jobs by filters (status, date range, company, etc.)
* Delete / archive past entries
* Maintain a record of application history

It can serve as the backend for a job dashboard, browser extension, mobile app, or web frontend.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

* CRUD operations for job entities
* Filter / query jobs by status, company, date, etc.
* Status tracking (e.g. ‚ÄúApplied‚Äù, ‚ÄúInterviewing‚Äù, ‚ÄúOffered‚Äù, ‚ÄúRejected‚Äù)
* Timestamping (created_at, updated_at)
* API input validation
* Error handling with meaningful responses
* (Optional) Authentication / authorization (if you‚Äôve included that)
* (Optional) Pagination, sorting of result sets

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

* **Language / Framework**: Java (Spring Boot, Jakarta EE, or your chosen framework)
* **Database**: (e.g. H2 / MySQL / PostgreSQL / MongoDB)
* **Build / Dependency Manager**: Maven (since there's a `pom.xml`)
* **Other Tools / Libraries**: (Specify any extras you used: Lombok, MapStruct, JPA, etc.)
* **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito, etc. (if used)

---

## üèó Architecture & Design

Describe your architectural decisions. For instance:

* Layered architecture: Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository / DAO
* Entity / model classes representing Job, Status, etc.
* DTOs for request / response payloads
* Exception handling (global exception handlers)
* Validation (e.g. `@Valid`, custom validators)
* Persistence using JPA / ORM / JDBC

If you have a class diagram or sequence diagram, include it (or host it in `/docs/` and link here).

---

## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java JDK (version x.x)
* Maven
* A running database (or embedded DB)
* (Optional) Postman / HTTP client to test API

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Carlos-Cao/Job-Tracker-API.git
   cd Job-Tracker-API
   ```

2. Configure database credentials in `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/jobtracker
   spring.datasource.username=yourusername
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Running the API

You can run via Maven or directly using the generated JAR:

```bash
# Using Maven
mvn spring-boot:run

# Or using the jar
java -jar target/job-tracker-api.jar
```

The API will start (commonly on `http://localhost:8080` or whichever port configured).

## üìÇ API Endpoints

Below is a sample of endpoints you might offer. Adjust to your actual paths, request bodies, etc.

| Method   | Endpoint         | Description                              | Request Body / Params                     |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/jobs`      | List all job applications (with filters) | Query params: status, company, date, page |
| `GET`    | `/api/jobs/{id}` | Get details of a specific job            | Path variable: `id`                       |
| `POST`   | `/api/jobs`      | Create a new job application             | JSON body with job data                   |
| `PUT`    | `/api/jobs/{id}` | Update job fields / status               | JSON body with fields to update           |
| `DELETE` | `/api/jobs/{id}` | Delete or archive a job record           | Path variable: `id`                       |

You may also have endpoints such as `/api/statuses` (if status is a separate entity), or `/api/jobs/{id}/notes`.

---

## üéØ Usage Examples

Here are sample HTTP requests and responses (using `curl` / JSON):

**Create a job:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "company": "Acme Corp",
        "position": "Backend Developer",
        "status": "Applied",
        "appliedDate": "2025-10-01",
        "notes": "Sent resume and cover letter"
      }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "company": "Acme Corp",
  "position": "Backend Developer",
  "status": "Applied",
  "appliedDate": "2025-10-01",
  "notes": "Sent resume and cover letter",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-01T12:34:56",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-01T12:34:56"
}
```

**Get all jobs with filter:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/jobs?status=Interviewing&page=0&size=10
```

**Update a job‚Äôs status:**

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/jobs/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "status": "Interviewing" }'
```

**Delete a job:**

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/jobs/1
```

## üîê Error Handling & Validation

* Requests with invalid data return errors (e.g. `400 Bad Request`) along with messages indicating what‚Äôs wrong.
* If a job ID is not found ‚Üí `404 Not Found`.
* Consistent error response format, e.g.:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T14:22:00",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "field ‚Äòcompany‚Äô must not be blank",
  "path": "/api/jobs"
}
```

Use global exception handling (e.g. `@ControllerAdvice` in Spring) to manage these responses.

---

## üß™ Testing

If you have tests (unit / integration), provide instructions to run them:

```bash
mvn test
```

Include some sample test cases for service layer, repository, controller. Test edge cases like:

* Creating with missing fields
* Updating non-existent job
* Query filters (invalid params)
* Deleting a record

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for where the project can grow:

* Add **Authentication / Authorization** (JWT, OAuth, role-based)
* Support **User accounts** with personal job lists
* Add **Notifications / Reminders** for follow-ups
* Add **File uploads** (resumes, cover letters)
* Richer filtering / search (by keyword, full-text search)
* Dashboard / analytics (e.g. count of open applications, trends)
* Web frontend or mobile client
* Export / import (CSV, Excel)
* Pagination, sorting, bulk updates
